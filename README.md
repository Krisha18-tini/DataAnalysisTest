# Diabetes Risk Prediction System

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
Project Description:

Diabetes is a persistent medical condition that arises from the body's failure to regulate blood glucose levels. Failure to diagnose diabetics in the early stages or neglecting to treat it can result in the development of several long-term chronic conditions, such as heart disease, chronic kidney disease, nerve damage, visual impairments, oral health problems, hearing issues, foot complications, and mental health disorders. Early prognosis can prevent certain chronic illnesses and facilitate appropriate intervention. Therefore, machine learning and artificial intelligence can be utilized to construct a predictive model that can discern correlations within data and generate an early prediction.

OBJECTIVE
The primary objective is to utilize computational intelligence techniques to construct an early predictive model for analysing the probabilities of individuals developing diabetes.

The csv file is obtained from Kaggle. This dataset is from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from year 2015. BRFSS is the nationâ€™s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions and use of preventive services.
